# IoT Cluster Simulation and Analysis

This repository holds the documentation and code of the project developed for SOCOF (Software Concorrente e Fiavel) curricular unit of MEI (Mestrado em Engenharia Informática) at ISEP (Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto). It addresses the topic of delegating tasks to a network of computers, mentioned as Slave nodes, from a central computer, mentioned as Master node, following the parallel programming paradigm.

The development was divided in three parts, being the first two the implementation of the slave and master nodes management and the last to prepare the solution to receive several types of input data and to review analyse it. Additionality coding guidelines were also defined in order to facilitate the communication between developers.

## Coding Guidelines

## Slave Node Implementation (Part 1)

## Master Node Implementation (Part 2)

## System Integration and Analysis (Part 3)
